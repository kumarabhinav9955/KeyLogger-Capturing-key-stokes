# KeyLogger-Capturing-key-stokes
I have done this project in training of my IBM SkillsBuild  brought to you by Edunet Foundation and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). 

This Python program implements a keylogger, which is a type of software that records the keystrokes made by a user on their computer. 
It utilizes the pynput library to monitor and capture key events. Each key event is stored in a list called key_list, which is later converted
to JSON format and saved to a file named 'logs.json'. The keylogger differentiated between the key press, key hold, and key release events.
